**Guvnor**  
*/ˈɡʌvnə/*  
*(British informal) A boss.*

Guvnor is a simple tool designed for deploying containerised applications onto a Linux host, with a Caddy reverse-proxy automatically configured to provide free TLS for your site.

Krystal developed Guvnor for our own simple deployment needs, where tools such as Kubernetes would have been overly complicated. We hope that you too may find it useful.

We use Guvnor to deploy Rails and Go containers, however, anything that runs in a container and exposes a port serving HTTP traffic can be deployed with Guvnor.
